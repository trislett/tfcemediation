# tfcemediation

tfcemediation is a high-performance statistics toolkit specifically optimized for neuroimaging data analysis.

This package provides memory-efficient implementations of standard and advanced statistical methods for both surface-based and volumetric neuroimaging data. Voxel-wise and vertex-wise analysis with permutation testing can be done in 1000s of subjects from a single computer or compute node. This package is the sucessor of [TFCE_mediation](https://github.com/trislett/tfce_mediation), which is now  depreciated. Major improvements have been made with respective to ease of use and overall efficiency. The software is written mostly in python with some sections written in c++ and cython for efficiency.

## Key Features
### Memory Efficiency: Process large neuroimaging datasets with minimal RAM through memory mapping
### Comprehensive Statistical Tools:

Linear regression with t-statistics and F-statistics
Mediation analysis for examining indirect neural pathways
Nested model comparisons for hypothesis testing

### Advanced Multiple Comparison Correction:

Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) for both surface and volumetric data
Non-parametric permutation testing with FWE correction


### Performance Optimized:

Parallel computation for permutation tests
Chunked processing to manage memory efficiently during intensive operations


### Flexible I/O:

Direct integration with pandas DataFrames
Support for both NIfTI and FreeSurfer file formats
